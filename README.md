## Version History

### Version 1

[Version 1](https://github.com/RyanMcCall/checkbook_application/blob/master/checkbook_v1/checkbook_v1.py) was the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) for this project. This version lacked many docstring and comments and the print statements could have been clearer. Also the code was left in the order that it was solved and not a more readable form.

### Version 2

[Version 2](https://github.com/RyanMcCall/checkbook_application/blob/master/checkbook_v2/checkbook_v2.py) was the cleaner iteration of the project. This version is better documented with docstrings and comments. The outputs are also more readable. Speaking of readability, the code is better too. Most of the print statements have been moved into functions so the the running code is better understood.

### Version 3

[Version 3](https://github.com/RyanMcCall/checkbook_application/blob/master/checkbook_v3/checkbook_v3.py) is the current working product. It has an added feature of showing the entire transaction history. Print statments have also been updated to include a taco pointer to help the user better find the last output. Also the keyword for exit the credit or debit entry was changed from ***exit*** to ***menu***.
